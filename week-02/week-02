         <p> 
            My name is Dibya Patnaik and I am from Robbinsville, New Jersey. I
            was originally born in New York but my parents moved when I was 4 years old. Some of my favorite things to do
            include hanging out with my friends and family, playing tennis, reading, and watching netflix. I also just enjoy being outside as much as I can.

            I am a supply chain management and entrepreneurship major in the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University.
            I am also minoring in information management and technology. I chose these majors and minor because I believe business and technology
            are the foundation of society.
